the idea behind this repository is to demonstate a file upload for a WYSIWYG EDITOR, and the marriage of the upload to the editor, as well as a submit to a PHP processing page so that the information can be stored in a MYSQL, SQLITE or other PHP compliant database. There is no tutorial, anywhere(that I have seen) for that.
HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF SOLUTION
